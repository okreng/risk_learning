\subsection*{Grounding}
\textbf{\newline Game Board:}
The game board consists of a connected graph of "territories" (nodes) that are occupied by players.  There are never any unoccupied territories and the graph is always fully connected.  Each occupied territory has armies that occupy it.  The number of armies must be a positive integer.
\textbf{\newline Game initialization:}
The game of Risk begins by randomly assigning territories evenly to each player.  Depending on the variant, there may be a choice for players to place some and/or all of their armies.  For our game, we will be assuming that both territories and armies are distributed evenly.\newline \newline
\textbf{Player Turns:}
Each player's turn has three distinct phases that occur in sequence: \newline 
\textbf{Army Placement Phase: }
During this phase, the player has $\text{Floor}(N/3)$ new armies to place, where $N$ is the number of territories that player controls.  The armies may be divided in any integer fashion amongst the territories the player occupies.  Existing armies cannot be moved from one territory to another during this step.\newline
\newline
\textbf{Attack Phase: }
During this phase, the player may conduct any number of attacks he/she chooses from his/her territories to connected territories.  The precondition for an attack is that there must be more than 1 army on an attacking territory.  If two player territories are connected two an opponent territory, the player must choose which territory to attack from, he/she cannot attack from both simultaneously.  The attacking player chooses whether to attack with 1, 2, or 3 armies, requiring a minimum of 2, 3, or 4 armies on the attacking territory, respectively (e.g. if a player has 3 armies on a territory, he/she can attack with 1 or 2 armies, but not three).  The defending player then chooses to defend with either 1 or 2 armies, unless he/she only has 1 army on the defending territory, in which case he/she can only defend with a single army.  Additionally, the defender can only defend with 1 army if he/she is being attacked by 1 army. The defender does not have the option of not defending. If an attack results in the defending player having no more armies on the territory, the attacking player must occupy the defending player's territory.  In this occupation step, the attacking player divides his/her armies between the attacking and captured territories, such that each territory has at least 1 army remaining. \newline

Each attack consists of the attacking and defending players rolling a number of dice equal to the armies they are choosing to engage with.  The results of the largest pair(s) of dice determine the result of the attack.  The defending player wins in the event of ties.  For each pair, whichever player loses must remove an army from his/her territory.  Attacks can be chosen from any territory that borders an enemy territory at any time.  The player conducts as many attacks as he/she desires before concluding the attack phase.\newline

Example: The attacking player has 4 armies on his territory, the defending player has 2 armies on his territory.  The attacking player rolls 3 dice, which result in: {2, 5, 6}.  The defending player rolls two dice, which result in: {6, 3}.  The largest pair(s) are A6-D6 and A5-D3 (the lowest die roll of the attacking player is discarded).  The attacking player loses the A6-D6 pair and must remove 1 army from his territory.  The defending player loses the A5-D3 pair and must remove 1 army from his territory.  Thus, the attacking player's territory has 3 armies after the attack, the defending player's territory has only 1.  Now, the attacking player chooses to attack with 2 armies again, the maximum that is allowed (since 1 army must remain on the territory).  This time, the defending player can only roll 1 die in defense, since he only has 1 remaining army on the territory. The results of the attacking dice are: {5, 1}, the results of the defending die is: {3}.  The highest pair is A5-D3 (the 2 lowest attacking dice are discarded).  The defending player must remove his remaining army from his territory, and the attacking player must occupy the territory.  At this point, the attacking player can choose to place either 1 or 2 armies on the captured territory.  He chooses to place 2.  Now, the captured territory can be used by the attacking player to launch new attacks on any connected territories occupied by other players.  The attacking player can now choose to perform another attack or enter the fortification phase.\newline

\textbf{Fortification Phase: }
During this phase, the player can choose to move any number of armies from a single territory to any adjacent territory he/she controls, such that both territories have at least 1 army remaining.

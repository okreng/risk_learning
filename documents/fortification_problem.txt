Consider the game of Risk
Consider the fortification phase, where a player can move any number of armies from a single territory to a neighboring territory also under that player's control

Given:	an action specified by the tuple (territory_from, territory_to)
	graph G with nodes occupied by known players with known number of armies
	
Determine: If there is an optimal number of armies >0 to move between the territories (CAN ONLY MOVE IN ONE DIRECTION).  
What is the optimal number?
If not, under what conditions are there optimal policies? Also specify the conditions for which there are no optimal policies.
What are those policies and under what conditions does optimality exist?

Assumptions: 	The player prefers not to lose armies or territories
		The player prefers to capture enemy territories and destroy enemy armies
			While you cannot assume any preference ranking of enemy territories,
			you know that modules with only 1 access node prefer armies closer to that node
		The more armies that exist on a territory, the less likely it is to be lost
		The territory being fortified is the least desirable to lose of all occupied territories
		
You can incorporate more assumptions, but state them explicitly if so

To start, consider the two simple cases of a three node graph with sequential connection:
	A<->B, B<->C
And the case of a three node graph with full connectivity
	A<->B, B<->C, A<->C

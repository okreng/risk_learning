"""
This file contains the function for random fortification
Each territory held by the player has an equal probability of being selected
Output is a random vector of size T^2
Assuming that it is strictly better to fortify somewhere rather than not fortify
Env will not fortify only if there are no valid moves specified

Env will determine how many troops to move
TODO: How to determine this?  Is there an optimal decision?
